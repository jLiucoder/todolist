* Files: (I will only list the necassary componenets)
        components/addTodo.js
        components/header.js
        components/TodoItem.js
        App.js
        README.md

Usage & Feature: 
    Add: add button on screen
    remove: long press item that the user would like to delete
    select: tap the item to select the item(s) 
    split/join: use buttons to control the selected item(s)

    The text box can be used as an input box, and when finished entering, press add todo to add it to the list.
    Then if the user would like to delete the item, long press the item to delete it from the list. in order to use the join and split feature, the user have to first select the items that he wnats to join/split. Then click on the corresponding button to proceed. The items will be merge to one or split to individual ones according to the user operation.

Difficulties: 
    I think the app has the basic functionalities but still have a lot of room to improve. it has some glitchs sometimes but I dont have enough time to test more. Also I have the color change when selected but I am not sure why there's no rendering when it is supposed to change color, that is why i added the alert box for better user exprience since the color doesn't work. 
    
Reflection:

    For this app that I built I used a lot of help from Stack Overflow, some blogs and Youtube, I enjoyed it a lot and explored a lot, can't wait for the future lectures and homeworks.
